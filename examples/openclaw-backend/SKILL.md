# cogmem Memory Backend for OpenClaw

Use this skill when an OpenClaw workspace needs `cogmem` as its durable memory backend.

## Ground Rules

- Use TOML config only: `~/.cogmem/config.toml` or project `.cogmem/config.toml`.
- Do not create .cogmem.env files.
- Do not pass `--env-path`.
- Do not configure kernel behavior through hidden environment variables; write TOML instead.
- Do not import `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, or `BOOTSTRAP.md`; they are operational instructions, not durable user memory.
- Do not run a separate vector search before calling `memory.recall()`. `KernelAgentMemoryBackend.recall()` is the first-class recall path and already performs pulse activation, temporal traversal, graph traversal, and narrative assembly.

## Install

Run from the OpenClaw workspace root:

```bash
COGMEM_SKIP_INIT=1 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuqin164/cogmem/main/install.sh | bash
cogmem init --yes --agent openclaw --scope project
cogmem doctor
cogmem connect openclaw --workspace . --auto --force
```

This creates project-local kernel config and storage under `.cogmem/`, which is the recommended OpenClaw workspace setup.

```bash
cogmem init --yes --agent openclaw --scope project
```

The install creates:

```text
.cogmem/config.toml
.cogmem/memory.db
.cogmem/snapshots/
```

To embed imported memories with a local quantized model, run Ollama locally and configure the kernel before importing:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3-embedding:0.6b
```

```toml
[core]
vector_dimension = 1024

[embedding]
provider = "openai_compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
model = "qwen3-embedding:0.6b"
```

Use the matching dimension for larger local models: `qwen3-embedding:4b` uses `2560`; `qwen3-embedding:8b` uses `4096`. Run `cogmem doctor` after editing. Imported records are embedded through the configured kernel embedder during `cogmem import-openclaw`.

Also configure `[memory_model]` for the Dream Curator. Embeddings are for recall; the memory model is the LLM that proposes candidate summaries, preferences, tags, conflicts, and diagnostics:

```toml
[memory_model]
provider = "openai_compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
model = "qwen2.5:7b"
api_key = ""
timeout_ms = 60000
```

## Migrate Existing OpenClaw Memory

Always preview first:

```bash
cogmem import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --dry-run
```

Then migrate:

```bash
cogmem import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw
```

Use JSON output when another agent is orchestrating the run:

```bash
cogmem import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --json
```

The importer is idempotent. Re-running it skips records already imported into the same memory database.
Real non-JSON imports print source-level and embedding+ingest progress to stderr. Use `--json --progress` to keep JSON on stdout while streaming progress to stderr, or `--no-progress` when a wrapper needs quiet stderr.

Imported sources:

- `USER.md` as user profile memory.
- `SOUL.md`, `PERSONA.md`, and `IDENTITY.md` as persona/profile memory.
- `MEMORY.md` as imported summary/index memory.
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and `memory/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` as daily episodic memory.
- `sessions/*.md`, `session-logs/*.md`, `session_logs/*.md`, `conversations/*.md`, `exports/sessions/*.md`, and `exports/conversations/*.md` as session memory.

Useful scoped imports:

```bash
cogmem import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --date 2026-05-07
cogmem import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --session ./custom-session.md
cogmem import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --memory ./custom-memory.md
cogmem import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --session ./one.md --session ./two.md
cogmem import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --memory ./one.md --memory ./two.md
```

## Runtime Wiring

Use `KernelAgentMemoryBackend` for turn storage and recall:

```ts
import {
  KernelAgentMemoryBackend,
  createMemoryKernelFromConfig,
} from 'cogmem';

const kernel = createMemoryKernelFromConfig();
const memory = new KernelAgentMemoryBackend(kernel);

await memory.rememberTurn({
  agentId: 'openclaw',
  projectId: 'openclaw',
  sessionId,
  userText,
  assistantText,
});

const recall = memory.recall({
  agentId: 'openclaw',
  projectId: 'openclaw',
  query: userText,
});

const preparedContext = {
  mode: recall.recallMode,
  narrative: recall.narrative,
  pulseTrace: recall.pulseTrace,
  temporalLabels: recall.temporalTraversal?.labels,
  memories: recall.items,
};
```

Use `recall.narrative` as the compact prompt context and `recall.items` as cited memory evidence. If `recall.recallMode === 'universe_navigation'`, the memory kernel has already prepared related context through the pulse/temporal/narrative path.

Each `recall.items[]` entry can include:

- `sourceType`: `compiled_memory`, `raw_ledger`, `raw_ledger_session`, or `imported_summary`.
- `canAnswerExactQuote`: only `true` means the item can support exact wording.
- `sourceAnchor`: the raw event/session/thread anchor.
- `sourceContext`: bounded raw event context with before/after events.
- `sourceContext.locator.command`: a local command such as `cogmem memory show --event <eventId> --before 2 --after 2`.

If the user asks for "原话", "具体内容", "完整脉络", "为什么当时这么判断", or "前后发生了什么", use `sourceContext` first. If more context is needed, run the locator command. Do not answer exact quotes from `compiled_memory` or `imported_summary` alone.

## Active Memory Search

If CogMem Retrieved Memory is absent, thin, or does not answer the user's question, do not answer "I do not remember" until you actively query CogMem. Use the kernel first, not the old `memory/` Markdown files:

```bash
cogmem memory recall --query "<user question>" --project openclaw --agent openclaw --json
```

Useful intents:

```bash
cogmem memory recall --query "上个会话我们聊了什么" --intent previous_session_summary --project openclaw --agent openclaw --session "$OPENCLAW_SESSION_ID" --exclude-session "$OPENCLAW_SESSION_ID" --json
cogmem memory recall --query "我关于记忆黑盒问题的原话是什么" --intent forensic_quote --project openclaw --agent openclaw --json
```

Use `items[].sourceContext` to understand what the user asked, how the agent answered, and nearby context. If the item has `sourceContext.locator.command`, run that command for a fuller local replay:

```bash
cogmem memory show --event <eventId> --before 2 --after 2 --json
```

Only fall back to searching OpenClaw's legacy `memory/` files when `cogmem memory recall` and `cogmem memory search` return no useful evidence or when the user explicitly asks to inspect the legacy files.

If old imported memories do not appear in `cogmem memory recall` after an upgrade, backfill raw ledger anchors before concluding the memory is missing:

```bash
cogmem import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --config .cogmem/config.toml --reindex-raw --json
```

This command is idempotent. It does not duplicate compiled memory or hot vectors; it only restores searchable raw anchors for older imports.

## OpenClaw Host Integration Notes

`cogmem connect openclaw` installs this file into `<workspace>/skills/cogmem-memory/SKILL.md`, which is OpenClaw's workspace skill location. That makes the procedure discoverable without changing OpenClaw host config.

Current OpenClaw memory config is OpenClaw-owned. Its documented backend selector is `memory.backend` with values such as `"builtin"` and `"qmd"`, and the built-in memory surface exposes tools such as `memory_search` and `memory_get`. Do not write `plugins.slots.memory` or other unknown OpenClaw config fields for cogmem; OpenClaw uses strict config validation and unknown fields can prevent the Gateway from starting.

To make every future OpenClaw turn automatically use the memory kernel, install the local plugin wrapper:

```bash
cogmem connect openclaw --workspace . --auto --force
```

`--auto` writes `<workspace>/extensions/cogmem-auto-memory/`, patches `plugins.load.paths`, and enables `hooks.allowPromptInjection=true` and `hooks.allowConversationAccess=true` for the wrapper. The wrapper registers `before_prompt_build` for governed recall and `agent_end` for turn recording, then calls `KernelAgentMemoryBackend` through `cogmem` public API via a Bun bridge. Core does not import OpenClaw.

Queued remember is the default. `agent_end` appends a durable JSONL job under `.cogmem/queue/openclaw-remember.jsonl` and spawns a background drain process, so Telegram or gateway responses are not blocked by embeddings, SQLite writes, or slow local models. If a drain fails, the job is retried and then moved to a dead-letter file instead of being silently discarded.

For high-dimensional embedding models, prefer `ingestMode = "selective_compile"` or `ingestMode = "raw_then_dream"`. `raw_then_dream` keeps all raw events in the chronological ledger and lets the Memory Curator / Dream Worker generate candidate memories later.

To enable local Ollama or cloud OpenAI-compatible curation, configure `[memory_model]` in `.cogmem/config.toml`; do not use hidden environment variables:

```toml
[memory_model]
provider = "openai_compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
model = "qwen2.5:7b"
api_key = ""
timeout_ms = 60000
```

Run curation manually or from a host-owned schedule:

```bash
cogmem memory dream --project openclaw --promote --json
cogmem memory govern --project openclaw --json
cogmem memory candidates --project openclaw --status candidate --json
```

The Dream Worker only proposes candidates such as user preferences, project memories, long-term goals, boundaries, failure lessons, diagnostic conclusions, session/topic summaries, temporal fact updates, and conflicts. CPU governance decides whether they remain provisional, need confirmation, become promoted, or are superseded/archived.
It also proposes semantic tags, indexing decisions, event relations, and edge-adjustment candidates so future recall can route by stable cues such as `memory/auditability`, `concept:memory_black_box`, and `need:source_drilldown` instead of matching only the user's full sentence. These are still governance candidates; do not treat them as verified facts until promoted by core governance.

For continuous curation, prefer a host-owned foreground worker over cron when the host can supervise long-running processes:

```bash
cogmem memory dream --project openclaw --watch --interval-ms 300000 --promote --json
```

`--watch` keeps processing new raw events until the host stops the process. `--promote` runs CPU governance after each dream pass, so the candidate queue does not grow forever. Without `--promote` or a separate `cogmem memory govern` run, candidates stay pending and will not become agent-facing compiled/provisional memory.

Queue interpretation:

- `candidate`: proposed but not yet governed; do not assume it will be injected.
- `promoted`: accepted by CPU governance. Summaries/preferences are provisional memory; semantic tags/indexing decisions/event relations/edge adjustments are organization metadata, not verified facts.
- `needs_confirmation`: uncertain or risky candidate. Provider warnings here are diagnostics, not user memory.
- `superseded`: older diagnostic or candidate has been replaced by newer evidence.

If provider warnings mention invalid memory-model output but later curation works, run `cogmem memory dream --project openclaw --promote --json`; recovered provider runs mark older provider warnings as `superseded`.

After package updates or config drift, repair the host wiring:

```bash
cogmem doctor --fix --agent openclaw --workspace .
```

The wrapper maps OpenClaw behavior to core like this:

- `memory_search` should call `memory.recall()` and return `recall.narrative` plus cited `recall.items`.
- `memory_get` should read from the cited evidence returned by core or from the original workspace file when a citation includes a file path.
- Prompt injection should use `recall.narrative`, not a raw vector nearest-neighbor dump.
- Turn capture should enqueue `memory.rememberTurnWithResult()` after the agent response. If OpenClaw exposes tool calls, tool results, or task events in the hook payload, the wrapper records them as ledger events with parent/child causality; if a result has no matching call, it is stored as a partial-causality task event instead of inventing a chain.

## Debug Recall

Normal prompt injection stays compact. When a user asks where a memory came from, why it was recalled, or why another candidate was filtered, run:

```bash
cogmem explain-recall --query "<user question>" --project openclaw --agent openclaw --json
```

Inspect `sourceAnchor`, `activationPath`, `whyMatched`, `filteredEvidence`, and `governanceReason`. `sourceAnchor` points back to raw ledger events or imported source files. `filteredEvidence` is for audit/debug and must not be injected wholesale into normal prompts.

When normal prompt injection contains `# CogMem Retrieved Memory`, treat it as historical memory selected by the kernel, not as the current conversation and not as a complete transcript. If the injected item includes `sourceContext`, it is allowed to explain what was asked, how it was answered, and nearby context. If it only includes an imported summary and `canAnswerExactQuote=false`, say that only a summary is available unless you can inspect raw source evidence.

After runtime wiring changes, run:

```bash
openclaw config schema
openclaw doctor
openclaw plugins inspect <plugin-id> --runtime --json
openclaw gateway restart
```

## MCP Bridge Option

If the OpenClaw environment exposes an MCP client, use the core MCP bridge instead of writing a native plugin first:

```bash
cogmem-mcp
```

Expose these tools to the agent:

- `cogmem_remember_turn`
- `cogmem_recall`
- `cogmem_explain_recall`
