# @CognitiveOS/core

Durable, local-first memory for agent frameworks.

`@CognitiveOS/core` is the standalone memory kernel. It does not import or require CognitiveOS. Use it when an agent such as OpenClaw, Hermes, LangGraph, or a custom runtime needs long-term memory with recall, provenance, snapshots, optional PII redaction, and optional encryption.

## Install

`@CognitiveOS/core` 2.0.0-rc.1 is a GitHub-only open-source release. It is not published to npm; install it from the GitHub repository or tag used for the core package.

```bash
export COGMEM_CORE_REPO="github:<owner>/CognitiveOS-core#v2.0.0-rc.1"
bun add "$COGMEM_CORE_REPO"
```

Core uses Bun because the default storage path uses `bun:sqlite`.

## Configure

For new users, start with the interactive wizard:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-init
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-doctor
```

For automation or CI smoke tests:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-init --yes --agent none --dry-run
```

The wizard creates a stable Cogmem home directory. By default this is `~/.cogmem`; project-local installs can use `cogmem-init --scope project`.

```text
~/.cogmem/
  config.toml
  memory.db
  embeddings/
  snapshots/
  logs/
```

The main configuration lives at `~/.cogmem/config.toml`:

```toml
[core]
db_path = "memory.db"
vector_backend = "sqlite-vec"
vector_dimension = 384

[governance]
pii_redact_email = true
pii_redact_phone = true
pii_redact_ssn = true
encryption = false

[memory_model]
provider = "rule_only"
```

Set `core.vector_dimension` to match the embedding model output. For example, `qwen3-embedding:8b` uses 4096 dimensions. High dimensions are supported, but `cogmem-doctor` warns at 2048+ dimensions because 4096-dimensional Float32 vectors use about 1.53 GiB for 100,000 memories before SQLite/index overhead.

TOML is the only configuration entrypoint. Environment variables are not read as global kernel configuration; they are only interpolated when explicitly referenced inside `config.toml`, for example `api_key = "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"`.

`[memory_model]` controls optional Memory Curator / Dream Worker LLM assistance. Leave it as `rule_only` for the deterministic local curator. To let the curator propose richer candidates with a local Ollama chat model, use OpenAI-compatible Ollama:

```toml
[memory_model]
provider = "openai_compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
model = "qwen2.5:7b"
api_key = ""
timeout_ms = 60000
```

For a cloud OpenAI-compatible endpoint, configure it explicitly:

```toml
[memory_model]
provider = "openai_compatible"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
api_key = "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
timeout_ms = 60000
```

The LLM is a curator only: it proposes memory candidates from raw ledger windows. CPU governance decides whether a candidate stays `candidate`, becomes `needs_confirmation`, or is later promoted/superseded/archived.

## SDK Quickstart

```ts
import { createMemoryKernelFromConfig } from '@CognitiveOS/core';

const kernel = createMemoryKernelFromConfig();

await kernel.ingest({
  content: 'The build must run with Bun because storage uses bun:sqlite.',
  projectId: 'demo-agent',
});

const recall = kernel.recall('what runtime does the build use?', {
  projectId: 'demo-agent',
  limit: 5,
});

console.log(recall.rawEvidence.map((item) => item.content));
```

## Agent Backend Facade

External agents should prefer `KernelAgentMemoryBackend` over low-level graph APIs.

```ts
import { KernelAgentMemoryBackend, createMemoryKernelFromConfig } from '@CognitiveOS/core';

const kernel = createMemoryKernelFromConfig();
const memory = new KernelAgentMemoryBackend(kernel);

await memory.rememberTurn({
  agentId: 'openclaw',
  projectId: 'workspace-a',
  sessionId: 'session-1',
  userText: 'Use sqlite-vec for the public release.',
  assistantText: 'Stored.',
  ingestMode: 'selective_compile',
});

const result = memory.recall({
  agentId: 'openclaw',
  projectId: 'workspace-a',
  query: 'which vector backend should the release use?',
});

console.log(result.recallMode); // "universe_navigation" unless the old recall path was needed
console.log(result.narrative?.headline);
console.log(result.pulseTrace);
console.log(result.temporalTraversal?.labels);
console.log(result.items);
```

`KernelAgentMemoryBackend.recall()` routes through universe navigation first. That means core activates related entities, temporal branches, and graph neighbors, assembles a narrative summary, and returns context that is already prepared for the agent. `MemoryKernel.recall()` remains available as the lower-level BrainRecall path; the backend uses it only as a fallback when universe navigation yields no scoped evidence. If both compiled recall paths miss, the backend can use bounded raw ledger FTS as `raw_ledger_fallback`; this returns only matching raw snippets within the evidence limit and does not dump whole threads into the prompt. Hosts can expose the same path as an active memory search command through `cogmem memory recall --query "<question>" --project <project> --agent <agent> --json`; this is the recommended fallback when automatic prompt injection is empty or too thin.

Adapters may pass `sessionId`, `threadId`, `excludeSessionId`, `intent`, `anchorEventId`, and `anchorText` when the user asks for session-aware or forensic recall. `KernelAgentMemoryBackend.recall()` compiles the user's raw question into a bounded `queryPlan` before search, so long questions such as "do you remember when we discussed CogMem Memory Context and the memory black box" are distilled into stable recall cues instead of using the full sentence as a brittle vector/FTS query. The query plan includes `semanticCuePhrases` and `temporalHints`, so wording drift such as "对话存档位置属于黑盒" versus "记忆黑盒问题" can still reach raw ledger evidence through cues like `记忆 黑盒`, `存档 黑盒`, and `黑盒`. `intent: "previous_session_summary"` reads the previous completed session from the chronological ledger instead of guessing through semantic recall. `intent: "forensic_quote"` returns raw user/source events with `sourceAnchor`, `sourceContext`, and `canAnswerExactQuote=true`; follow-up questions such as "what were my exact words" can pass the previous recall anchor to drill down to the raw event. Compiled memories and imported summaries set `canAnswerExactQuote=false` and must not be presented as exact wording, but they may still include `sourceContext` and a `sourceLocator` command such as `cogmem memory show --event <eventId> --before 2 --after 2` so the agent can inspect the original raw event and surrounding context. This keeps chronological replay separate from ranked context recall.

Turn recording supports four modes:

- `immediate_compile`: legacy behavior; records raw events and immediately creates compiled vector-backed memory.
- `selective_compile`: records every raw turn but only compiles durable signals such as explicit preferences, constraints, corrections, decisions, goals, failures, lessons, and procedures.
- `raw_archive_only`: records only raw ledger events for replay/audit.
- `raw_then_dream`: records raw events and exposes dream backlog status for later consolidation.

For OpenClaw/Hermes automatic turn recording with high-dimensional Qwen embeddings, prefer `selective_compile` or `raw_then_dream`. This keeps full raw evidence while avoiding a high-dimensional vector for every sentence.

Run the dream curator when `raw_then_dream` backlog exists:

```ts
const result = await kernel.runDreamCurator({ projectId: 'workspace-a', limit: 100 });
console.log(result.candidateCount);
console.log(kernel.listDreamCandidates({ projectId: 'workspace-a', statuses: ['candidate'] }));
```

The curator is candidate-only. In `rule_only` mode it is deterministic and local-first. It creates window summaries, explicit preference/constraint candidates, correction candidates, semantic tag candidates, indexing decision candidates, event relation candidates, and edge-adjustment candidates. When `[memory_model]` is configured with an OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint, it can also ask the memory model to propose richer candidates: user preferences, project memories, long-term goals, prohibitions/boundaries, failure lessons, diagnostic conclusions, session summaries, topic summaries, temporal fact updates, conflicts, semantic tags, indexing decisions, semantic relations, and edge adjustments. All candidates are stored in the deep-write governance queue with raw event source anchors. It does not create hot vectors, does not delete raw ledger events, and does not promote candidates to verified facts.

Core exposes schedule helpers for hosts that want background curation without turning core into a daemon:

- `manual`: an operator or agent runs `cogmem memory dream`.
- `interval`: cron/systemd runs it every N milliseconds.
- `daily`: cron/systemd runs it at configured local times, such as `03:30` and `15:30`.
- `continuous`: the host adapter runs it when raw backlog has been idle for a configured period.

Use `describeDreamCuratorWorkflow()` and `nextDreamCuratorRunAt()` to make these schedules explicit in adapters. The host owns timers; core only processes a bounded ledger window when called.

## Memory Model

Core separates raw chronological evidence from ranked recall. The Chronological Memory Ledger records ordered raw events for replay and audit; governed recall ranks memories by relevance, importance, confidence, recency, scope, pulse activation, and inhibition.

Use `MemoryKernel.getThreadEvents(threadId)` to replay raw events in ledger order and `MemoryKernel.getEventContext(eventId, { before, after })` to inspect surrounding source context. Use `KernelAgentMemoryBackend.recall()` for current agent context. Do not use replay as a prompt dump.

Use `MemoryKernel.searchRawEvents(query, { projectId })` when you need to find original raw evidence that may not have compiled memory or a hot vector. This raw FTS/metadata path is for source discovery and cold recall; it is not the default agent context ranking path.

Existing OpenClaw/Hermes importers now write raw ledger anchors for imported records before ingesting compiled/index memory. Imported daily summaries remain `imported_summary` evidence with `canAnswerExactQuote=false`, but they are searchable through raw ledger and can carry `sourceContext` so an agent can say where the summary came from instead of treating it as a black box.

If an older CogMem version already imported legacy records before raw ledger anchors existed, backfill the anchors without duplicating compiled memory or vectors:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --config .cogmem/config.toml --reindex-raw --json
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-hermes --workspace . --project hermes --config .cogmem/config.toml --reindex-raw --json
```

Vector pruning is not memory pruning. `cogmem compact` deletes only eligible vector blobs from `vector_index`; it does not delete raw ledger events, sourceRefs, chronological ordering, or tool-call parent/child links.

Semantic memories can point back to raw events through `sourceRefs`; `explainRecallWithKernel()` includes `sourceAnchor` when provenance is available. See `MEMORY_MODEL.md` and `RECALL_EXPLAINABILITY.md`.

External agents can record lifecycle events through the narrow facade without importing host runtime concepts:

```ts
await memory.ingestToolCall({
  agentId: 'openclaw',
  projectId: 'workspace-a',
  sessionId: 'session-1',
  threadId: 'thread-1',
  assistantEventId,
  toolCallId: 'call-1',
  toolName: 'read_file',
  input: { path: 'migration.ts' },
});

await memory.ingestToolObservation({
  agentId: 'openclaw',
  projectId: 'workspace-a',
  sessionId: 'session-1',
  threadId: 'thread-1',
  toolCallEventId,
  toolCallId: 'call-1',
  toolName: 'read_file',
  output: 'migration.ts contains an idempotent ALTER TABLE.',
});
```

`ingestToolObservation()` stores a raw `tool_result` ledger event and an `external_tool` semantic evidence candidate with `sourceRefs`. It does not promote tool output into a verified fact.

## Governed Recall And Explainability

Agent-facing recall is governed by default. `KernelAgentMemoryBackend.recall()`, `MemoryKernel.navigateMemory()`, and `BrainRecall` exclude non-recallable evidence from active context before returning `rawEvidence` or backend `items`.

- `rawEvidence` contains evidence allowed to enter active agent context.
- `filteredEvidence` is available from `MemoryKernel.navigateMemory()` and `explainRecallWithKernel()` for forensic recall/explain flows. It records same-project candidates that were not included.
- `reason` stays backward compatible. For governance filtering it remains `status_suppressed`; for budget filtering it is `over_context_limit`.
- `governanceReason` is an optional refinement for `status_suppressed`, such as `archived`, `suspect_llm_inference`, `suspect_external_tool_observation`, or `suspect_unverified_claim`.

Raw user utterances may be recalled as provenance evidence when they are explicitly tagged as raw user evidence (`sourceType: 'user_input'`, `reliability:raw_utterance`, `role:user`, and `record:raw_utterance` or `record:conversation_message`). This does not promote the utterance into a durable fact; it only allows the original user statement to be inspected as evidence. Suspect LLM inference, suspect tool observation, and unverified suspect claims stay out of active context.

Use `cogmem-explain-recall --json` or the `cogmem_explain_recall` MCP tool to inspect `filteredEvidence`, `governanceReason`, activation paths, and narrative recall reasons. Explain output is project-scoped; filtered evidence from other projects is not exposed in a scoped explain result.

Core is an agent memory kernel, not a knowledge-base application, wiki front end, Obsidian replacement, UI dashboard, or agent framework. Markdown imports and exports are projections/adapters; the source of truth is the kernel store and public API.

## Import Existing Agent Memory

Use the import tools when an external agent already has memory files and needs to migrate them into the kernel store. Always run `--dry-run` first. Import is project-scoped and idempotent; re-running against the same database skips records already processed by the cursor store.

Imported records are embedded through the configured kernel embedder. To import through a local quantized embedding model, configure the kernel before running the importer. For example, with Ollama:

JSON/JSONL/CSV/TSV transcript exports should be normalized before batch ingestion. The normalizer emits per-message source anchors so imported `sourceRefs` preserve original array order, CSV row line, or block ordinal when available.

Normalize a JSON array transcript:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-normalize-transcript \
  --input ./memory.json \
  --output ./memory.normalized.md \
  --family json-array \
  --dry-run --json

./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-normalize-transcript \
  --input ./memory.json \
  --output ./memory.normalized.md \
  --family json-array
```

Normalize CSV or TSV transcript exports:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-normalize-transcript \
  --input ./memory.csv \
  --output ./memory.normalized.md \
  --family csv \
  --dry-run --json

./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-normalize-transcript \
  --input ./memory.tsv \
  --output ./memory.normalized.md \
  --family tsv
```

Supported `--family` values are `json-array`, `jsonl`, `csv`, `tsv`, `app-private-mixed-event`, and `jsonl-mixed-event-log`. If omitted, `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.csv`, and `.tsv` are inferred from the input extension.

The output is normalized conversation Markdown. Each normalized message includes an `agent-brain-source-ref` comment when the original source offset, JSON array index, CSV row line, or ordering confidence is available. `cogmem-normalize-transcript` does not open a memory database, run recall, change pulse activation, or install runtime features; it only prepares source-preserving Markdown for later import.

```bash
ollama pull qwen3-embedding:0.6b
```

```toml
[core]
db_path = "memory.db"
vector_backend = "sqlite-vec"
vector_dimension = 1024

[embedding]
provider = "openai_compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
model = "qwen3-embedding:0.6b"
```

Set `core.vector_dimension` to the embedding model output dimension. `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` uses 1024 dimensions, `qwen3-embedding:4b` uses 2560 dimensions, and `qwen3-embedding:8b` uses 4096 dimensions.

OpenClaw default workspace import:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --dry-run
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw
```

The importer prints source-level and record-level progress to stderr during real non-JSON imports, including the embedding+ingest stage. JSON output stays on stdout; pass `--json --progress` to keep machine-readable stdout while streaming progress to stderr. Use `--no-progress` for quiet automation.

OpenClaw explicit single-file or batch import:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --session ./one.md
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --session ./one.md --session ./two.md
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --memory ./one.md
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --memory ./one.md --memory ./two.md
```

Hermes default workspace import:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-hermes --workspace . --project hermes --dry-run
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-hermes --workspace . --project hermes
```

Hermes explicit path import:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-hermes --workspace . --project hermes --profile ./memory/profile.md --sessions ./memory/sessions
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-hermes --workspace . --project hermes --session ./one.md
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-hermes --workspace . --project hermes --session ./one.md --session ./two.md
```

Pass `--json` when automation needs machine-readable counts for scanned sources, parsed records, ingested records, skipped records, and source-level results. The importers migrate memory evidence only; they do not install host runtime features, task schedulers, channels, dashboards, or application code.

## OpenClaw

Core includes a first-party OpenClaw workspace profile. It recognizes `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, `PERSONA.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, `memory/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, and session export folders.

To install the agent-facing skill file into an OpenClaw workspace:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-connect openclaw --workspace .
```

This writes `<workspace>/skills/cogmem-memory/SKILL.md`, OpenClaw's workspace skill location. The skill tells an agent how to install, validate, dry-run migration, migrate, and wire `KernelAgentMemoryBackend` without changing OpenClaw host config automatically.

To make OpenClaw automatically recall and record memory on every future turn, install the first-party local plugin wrapper:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-connect openclaw --workspace . --auto --force
```

`--auto` writes `<workspace>/extensions/cogmem-auto-memory/`, patches OpenClaw `plugins.load.paths`, and enables the plugin entry with `hooks.allowPromptInjection=true` and `hooks.allowConversationAccess=true`. The wrapper registers `before_prompt_build` for governed recall and `agent_end` for turn recording. `agent_end` uses queued remember by default: it appends a durable JSONL job under `.cogmem/queue/` and spawns a background drain process, so slow embeddings or SQLite writes do not block Telegram/gateway response delivery. It calls `KernelAgentMemoryBackend` through `@CognitiveOS/core` public API via a Bun bridge; core still does not import OpenClaw or become an OpenClaw runtime.

The OpenClaw wrapper injects retrieved history under `# CogMem Retrieved Memory`. Current conversation context remains OpenClaw-owned and separate from long-term memory. The wrapper uses a small CPU intent router: "previous session" style questions pass `intent: "previous_session_summary"` and exclude the current session; exact wording questions pass `intent: "forensic_quote"` and require raw ledger anchors. Imported `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` summaries remain provenance support and are marked `canAnswerExactQuote=false`, so an agent should say it only has a summary when raw source text is unavailable.

When debugging recall, use:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-explain-recall --query "<user question>" --project openclaw --agent openclaw --json
```

The JSON explains `sourceAnchor`, `activationPath`, `whyMatched`, `filteredEvidence`, and `governanceReason`. Keep normal prompt injection compact; do not inject full debug output into ordinary agent turns.

If an existing installation needs repair after an update:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-doctor --fix --agent openclaw --workspace .
```

OpenClaw config is still OpenClaw-owned (`memory.backend` supports backends such as `"builtin"` and `"qmd"`). Do not add unknown host config fields for CognitiveOS-core and do not write `plugins.slots.memory`. Runtime integration must go through the installed local plugin wrapper or another explicit adapter that calls the public kernel API.

Run the command after configuration to migrate existing OpenClaw memory into the kernel:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-init --agent openclaw --scope project
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-doctor
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw --dry-run
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-openclaw --workspace . --project openclaw
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-connect openclaw --workspace . --auto --force
```

This installs and validates the kernel store, migrates existing OpenClaw memory evidence, installs the agent-facing workspace skill, and installs the local automatic memory plugin. Restart the OpenClaw Gateway after changing plugin code, hook policy, or `plugins.load.paths`.

```ts
import { OpenClawWorkspaceProfile, createMemoryKernelFromConfig } from '@CognitiveOS/core';

const kernel = createMemoryKernelFromConfig();
const profile = new OpenClawWorkspaceProfile(process.cwd());

for (const source of profile.buildInstalledBatchSources({ projectId: 'openclaw' })) {
  // Use MarkdownSourceLoader plus the exported source adapters to ingest source records.
  console.log(source);
}
```

See `examples/openclaw-backend/README.md` and `examples/openclaw-backend/SKILL.md`.

## Hermes

Core includes a conservative Hermes profile for filesystem-based memory exports:

- `profile.md` as durable profile/persona memory
- `sessions/**/*.md` as conversation/session memory

To install the agent-facing skill file into a Hermes workspace:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-connect hermes --workspace .
```

This writes `~/.hermes/skills/cogmem-memory/SKILL.md`, Hermes's primary skill location. The skill tells an agent how to install, validate, dry-run migration, migrate, wire `KernelAgentMemoryBackend`, and add the optional `cogmem-mcp` server without changing `~/.hermes/config.yaml` automatically.

Run the command after configuration to migrate existing Hermes memory into the kernel:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-init --agent hermes
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-doctor
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-hermes --workspace . --project hermes --dry-run
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-import-hermes --workspace . --project hermes
```

If a Hermes install uses different paths, pass `profilePath` and `sessionDir` explicitly.

```ts
import { HermesWorkspaceProfile } from '@CognitiveOS/core';

const profile = new HermesWorkspaceProfile(process.cwd());
const sources = profile.buildSourceDefinitions({
  projectId: 'hermes',
  profilePath: 'profile.md',
  sessionDir: 'sessions',
});

console.log(sources);
```

See `examples/hermes-backend/README.md` and `examples/hermes-backend/SKILL.md`.

## CLI

```bash
cogmem                   # unified command dispatcher: cogmem doctor, cogmem connect, cogmem update
cogmem-init              # interactive setup
cogmem-doctor            # validates config.toml and opens the kernel; --storage reports vector/raw ledger storage pressure; --fix repairs OpenClaw auto wiring
cogmem-connect           # install OpenClaw/Hermes agent-facing SKILL.md files; openclaw --auto installs runtime hooks
cogmem-update            # package update helper; equivalent to cogmem update
cogmem-compact           # dry-run or apply vector-only compaction; defaults to dry-run unless --apply is passed
cogmem-memory            # local audit console for memory status/list/search/show
cogmem-explain-recall    # explain pulse/temporal/narrative recall decisions
cogmem-mcp               # stdio MCP server exposing cogmem memory tools
cogmem-import-openclaw   # migrate OpenClaw workspace memory into core
cogmem-import-hermes     # migrate Hermes profile/session memory into core
cogmem-normalize-transcript # normalize JSON/JSONL/CSV/TSV transcript exports to source-ref Markdown
cogmem-snapshot          # export/import snapshot helper
cogmem-re-embed          # re-embedding helper
cogmem-migrate-vectors   # vector backend migration helper; uses config vector_dimension unless --dimension is passed
```

Storage inspection and safe vector compaction:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem-doctor --storage
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem compact --dry-run --status archived,suspect,cold --json
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem compact --apply --status archived,suspect
```

Run `--dry-run` first. Use `--apply` only after snapshotting the database and ensuring no live writer is active.

Memory audit console:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem memory status --config .cogmem/config.toml
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem memory list --project openclaw --json
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem memory search --query "记忆 黑盒" --project openclaw --json
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem memory recall --query "我们之前是不是讨论过记忆黑盒的问题" --project openclaw --agent openclaw --json
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem memory show --event evt-... --before 2 --after 2 --json
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem memory dream --project openclaw --json
./node_modules/.bin/cogmem memory candidates --project openclaw --status candidate --json
```

`cogmem memory` is intentionally a local provenance console, not a wiki, Obsidian replacement, or hosted dashboard. Use it to inspect raw ledger anchors, source context, vector pressure, dream backlog coverage, and the candidate governance queue when the injected prompt context feels like a black box.

Benchmark groups are documented in `BENCHMARKS.md`; `memory_natural_emergence` tracks recall, inhibition, leakage, provenance, budget, and pulse expansion metrics.

## Public API Policy

The package entrypoint exports explicit stable and beta symbols only. Internal implementation stores and compilers are not exported from `@CognitiveOS/core`.

Stable integration APIs include `MemoryKernel`, `createMemoryKernelFromConfig()`, `KernelAgentMemoryBackend`, `compileAgentRecallQuery()`, `runDreamCurator()` / `listDreamCandidates()` on `MemoryKernel`, `OpenClawWorkspaceProfile`, and `HermesWorkspaceProfile`. Advanced recall orchestration symbols such as `UniverseNavigator`, `PulseRetrievalEngine`, `TemporalBranchSearch`, `NarrativeRecallAssembler`, `explainRecallWithKernel`, and the `listCogmemMcpTools` / `callCogmemMcpTool` helpers are exported as beta APIs for agents that need direct inspection, custom routing, or MCP hosting.

## Development

```bash
bun run --filter '@CognitiveOS/core' type
bun run --filter '@CognitiveOS/core' build
bun run --filter '@CognitiveOS/core' test
```

Release dry-run for the GitHub-only package:

```bash
cd packages/core
npm pack --dry-run --json
```

If the local npm cache is not writable, use a temporary cache instead:

```bash
npm_config_cache="$(mktemp -d)" npm pack --dry-run --json
```

Do not run `npm publish`; this package is released through GitHub source distribution only.
